    The cluster model creates pre-computer spatial cluster analysis for all
    sites and all record in a geographic region.
    The clustering is based on :
    - different geographical areas for different scales.
    - module of record based on biological_collection model. E.g. Fish.

    E.g. small scales will cluster by country, larger scale by province,
    catchment etc.
    The cluster units are configurable based on the boundary model.
