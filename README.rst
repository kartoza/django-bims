Quick Project Setup
-------------------

Refer to `project setup guide`_ for in depth information.

Make sure ansible is installed, all.yml file is configured, and project
already opened using PyCharm. Then run these command:

    make ansible-check

This will check and dry-run ansible tasks

    make setup-ansible

This will generate project file configuration.


Quick Installation Guide
------------------------
For deployment we use `docker`_ so you need to have docker
running on the host. HealthyRivers is a django app so it will help if you have
some knowledge of running a django site.

    git clone git://github.com/kartoza/django-bims.git
    
    make build
    
    make permissions
    
    make web
    
    # Wait a few seconds for the DB to start before to do the next command
    
    make migrate
    
    make collectstatic
    

So as to create your admin account:
```
make superuser
```


Install as a Django Package
---------------------------

1. Add "bims" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this:

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'bims',
    ]

2. Include the bims URLconf in your project urls.py like this:

    path('bims/', include('bims.urls'))

3. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the bims models.


Optional keys on project
---------------------------
To use some feature, there are keys that needs to be included on the project.
Please put the keys on the secret.py

The keys are:

1. To show bing map, use your key of bing (https://www.bingmapsportal.com/) and put it in `core/settings/secret.py` with key BING_MAP_KEY

2. To show openmaptile map (terrain and other style), use your key of maptile (https://www.maptiler.com/cloud/) and put it in `core/settings/secret.py` with key MAP_TILER_KEY
