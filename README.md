## Welcome

Welcome to the Biodiversity Information Management System (BIMS) Source Code Repository

The latest source code is available at http://github.com/kartoza/django-bims.

BIMS is a platform for managing and visualising biodiversity data.

Make your data available to decision makers, researchers & biologists.

This project is a [Freshwater Researcy Centre](https://www.frcsa.org.za/) FRC Initiative, supported by [Kartoza](https://kartoza.com) as implementing partner.

See a running instance at https://freshwaterbiodiversity.org/

* **Developers:** See our `project setup guide`_ and `developer guide`_

## Quick Installation Guide

For deployment we use `docker`_ so you need to have docker
running on the host. HealthyRivers is a django app so it will help if you have
some knowledge of running a django site.

    git clone git://github.com/kartoza/django-bims.git

    make build

    make permissions

    make web

    # Wait a few seconds for the DB to start before to do the next command

    make migrate

    make collectstatic

    # Finally we can rebuild our search indexes if needed

    make rebuildindex


So as to create your admin account:
```
make superuser
```
